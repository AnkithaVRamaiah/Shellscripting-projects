### Problem Statement:

As a DevOps engineer, you manage multiple repositories on GitHub. It’s essential to ensure that only authorized users have access to these repositories. When someone resigns or leaves the organization, their access needs to be revoked promptly. This can be a manual and error-prone process, especially when managing large teams and repositories. To automate this process and maintain proper access controls, we can use a shell script that interacts with the GitHub API to list the users who have access to a specific repository.

### Solution:

We can create a shell script that leverages GitHub’s API to:
1. **List users with read access** to a repository.
2. Ensure proper access management, especially when revoking access for users who no longer need it (e.g., resigned employees).
3. The script takes the GitHub organization name and repository name as input and lists all users with read (pull) access.

#### **Steps to Implement**:
1. **Launch an EC2 instance** where you will run the script.
2. **Connect to the EC2 instance** using SSH.
3. **Write or clone the script** on the instance.
4. **Set up the GitHub authentication** using your GitHub username and personal access token.
5. **Grant permission to the script**: You need to make the script executable by running `chmod 777 filename.sh`.
6. **Execute the script**: Run `./filename.sh <organization_name> <repo_name>` to get a list of users with read access.

#### **Shell Script Explanation**:

- The script makes use of the **GitHub API** to fetch information about the repository's collaborators.
- It then filters the users who have **read access** (pull permission) to the repository and lists them.


### **How to Explain**:

1. **Project Purpose**:
   - "In this project, I created a shell script that integrates with GitHub's API to automate the process of checking which users have access to a specific repository. This is crucial for DevOps roles where maintaining proper access control is vital, especially for repositories in an organization."

2. **Why It Matters**:
   - "As a DevOps engineer, I often have to manage multiple repositories. It’s important to ensure that only authorized users can access these repositories. When a person leaves the company, their access needs to be removed promptly to avoid security risks. Instead of manually checking and removing users, this script automates the process of listing users who have access, making the process faster and more efficient."

3. **How It Works**:
   - "The script uses GitHub’s API to list all users with read access to a given repository. It takes the repository name and the organization name as input, fetches the list of collaborators, and filters out users who only have read access."
   
4. **Technology Used**:
   - "I used GitHub's REST API to fetch repository collaborator information, along with `curl` for HTTP requests and `jq` for JSON parsing."
   
5. **Benefits**:
   - "This solution automates access control, reduces human error, and helps maintain security and compliance within the organization."
   
6. **Future Enhancements**:
   - "In the future, I could expand this script to also handle revoking access for users who no longer need it, ensuring the repositories are always secure and up-to-date with access control."

By explaining the project in this way, you demonstrate your technical understanding and show how this tool could solve a real-world problem in DevOps.
